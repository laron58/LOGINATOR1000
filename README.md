## SCRAPERTRON1000, a Python Amazon Web Scraper/Tracker
### Usage:
IMPORTANT!! The file `urls.txt` is an OPTIONAL download with 7 example Amazon links. `scrapertron.py` can work as a standalone program and will create any needed files.

Make sure you `cd` to the correct folder where scrapertron.py is located before running. Otherwise, the program may not be able to read files.

To add links to `urls.txt` via console, use `CTRL + Shift + V` to paste links when prompted.

Always leave an extra empty line at the bottom of the text files so the program can properly append new info.
